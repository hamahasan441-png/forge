# TODO — not completed

Completed enhancements **do not keep a PLAN-vN.md**. Ship, delete the plan,
move leftovers here as `- [ ]`. Do not check an item until it has shipped
and tests are green. Never mark complete because a model wrote a spec.

Shipped (gone from this list): v54 knowgap, v55 acquire, v56 ingest,
v57 priority, v58 skilllife, v59 contradict, v60 blast, v62 skilldl,
v63 verify, v64 wire, v65 discover, v66 learn, v67 evidence, v68 stale,
v76 live, v77 skillver, v78 experiment (gap hypothesis → focused test → recordGapOutcome; skill from a gap; playbook benchmark).
See CHANGELOG.

Standing rules: no kernel rewrite, no second data root, no page dump,
`assumeYes` stays false, compose never writes. `FORGE_DATA_DIR` aliases
`FORGE_HOME` (`~/.forge`) — never `Forge/data/` under the checkout.
DOWNLOAD ≠ TRUST.

## Skill forge 2.0

- [ ] ZIP/folder skill ingest (unpack still not this kernel)

## Knowledge

- [ ] Knowledge dock in chat without a live TUI store (CLI-only status)

## Strategy / tools / models

- [ ] Strategy 2.0 (beyond v40 `evolveRun` score/avoid)
- [ ] Toolintel 2.0 (beyond v52 aggregates)
- [ ] Model empirics from real outcomes (not a static registry)
- [ ] Consolidate lessons + memory without dropping provenance

## Tests / architecture

- [ ] Gap tests that are not explicit still never invent a toolchain

## Bench / agents / kernel

- [ ] Bench 2.0
- [ ] Multi-agent roles
- [ ] Kernel evolution **only** in an isolated worktree (L6 — not now)

## Known reds (not features)

- [ ] plugin-iso on Node 22 (`--allow-net` missing)
- [ ] chat-compact empty mock-body flake

## Never

- [ ] Research crawler / webpage dump as VERIFIED
- [ ] Auto-ACTIVE or auto-learn because a download succeeded
- [ ] Second `FORGE_DATA_DIR` tree / `Forge/data/` under the checkout
- [ ] Flip `assumeYes` or `allowNewPlugins` by default
- [ ] Write `~/.forge/tools` from skill authoring or download
